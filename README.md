# PyToNotes

This is a hobby project to record sound, and get a note sheet for the music that was recorded.

## Status

For now it works by running the main.py file, it will then ask you for duration of recording, bpm and time measure.
After this you hit enter when prompted to start the recording.
This will generate a LilyPond file that can be opened with LilyPond to see the note sheet.
